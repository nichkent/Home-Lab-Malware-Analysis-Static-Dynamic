# Malware-Analysis
This repository contains the reports for all malware analyses performed in my home lab.

The home lab itself is made up of two virtual machines. The first is a windows VM that is run through Virtual Box. This machine has had FlareVM loaded over the original Windoes 10 installation. FlareVM is a common malware analysis OS, that comes preinstalled with many tools for analysts to use to asses the processes of a particular program. These tools include:
- sysinternals (TCPView.exe, floss.exe, etc.)
- PEView
- Ida
- Many more

The virtual machine uses states to maintain the integrity of the host operating system after malware execution. After detonation of the malware, the windows machine can be reverted back to it's previous snapshot, restoring all function to the for additional malware testing to be done.

The second VM is a linux distribution of Remnux. This is a malware analysis distribution of linux that is mostly used to decode and capture web traffic that a process generates. It does so in a closed environment using inetsim (fake internet connection) that auto resolves any DNS to the host IP of the linux device. This makes it so that the malware never reaches the outside network from within the home lab but traffic capture generated from the malware is still possible.
